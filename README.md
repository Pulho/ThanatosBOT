# Thanatos Discord BOT
Bot made in Python language and solely for use in discord. Project made among friends that aims to improve and deepen certain concepts such as Async, API and database. Besides being a fun project to pass the time :D

## Special Thanks
First of all to my friend [João Alberto](https://github.com/joaoalbertos) that presented us with the arts of Thanatos, giving a little more life and cheer to the project.
Second to my friend [Paulo Vinicius Fernandes](https://github.com/pvfls), who also is a dev on this project for helping me out with database.

# Functions
## Help command
Here we have some of the functions implemented ( Some of them need some fix, like the cat and dog, but one step at time ). You can see the actual design display of the help function and the explication of each command. And also, the playlists functions are not working yet, as i explain in the [Upcoming topic](https://github.com/Pulho/ThanatosBOT#Upcoming).

## Actual song display
For each song requested we highlight your name, the user who requested such music, the URL of the song, its duration and your thumb. We also added a slogan that we found funny to the bot "Thanatos, killing your boredom" in reference to its appearance as "reaper".

## Queue display
Here we have the design of the queue where we have multiple pages containing a maximum of ten songs per page. We also show the icon of the person who requested the command at the end of the command.

# Upcoming
* As much as we have the semi code ready at hand for personal playlists with database, we're studying the best way to get it on the air. Because of this, the database implementation along with the code is not active, so no personal playlists for now.
* We are also studying the possibility of streaming videos via discord broadcast, so that we have even more a range of possibilities.
